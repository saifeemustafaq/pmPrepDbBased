With the current analytics as it is now, are we achieving this:

Which question is clicked and expanded the most.
Which question has been marked complete the most.
which section in the sidebar is clicked the most
Which question has user spent most time on.
Which category has user spent most time on.
How many users used the Overall Notes in the right sidebar
how many users have revisited the app after visiting it once

This whole app is being hosted on vercel.

Again , remember we dont want to implement any storage with mongodb or somewhere else, I just want to ensure that each and all data is being tracked and sent to google analytics so that I can view and use that data later.
